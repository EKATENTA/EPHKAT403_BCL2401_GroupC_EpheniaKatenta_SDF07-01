In this project , I was to recreate a simple mobile web app .

i felt  confident using flexbox to structure my Mobile App ,as i worked with it last week .

My app is responsive and the buttons shadow-box are working. Image for the logo and icons was downloaded from chrome .

Hover implementation was successfull it was helpful that i learned about how to correctely implement it making it a lot easier to implement it in this project.

I had a challenge understanding firebase database but with research and a lot of help from my class mates i was able to understand it and create it , an most important implemented it in my project.

favicon : It was the first time i heard about it , but the creation and implementation was  very interesting for me. I really enjoyed learning abot them and how they work.
 

I wish to improve on my knowladge on javascript and different ways of writing js code.

Overall i enjoyed working on this project and i can not wait to see the other projects we will be getting , as stressfull as it is i believe it is worth it .
